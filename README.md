##Sublime Text Package for the Modelica Language

Sublime Text editor comes without syntax definitions for  [Modelica language](http://www.modelica.org) by default, so the purpose of the package is to bring Modelica language support to Sublime Text and also to provide snippets for commonly used language patterns.

###Installation

First [Install Package Controll for Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (if you still have not done so) and restart Sublime Text.

Then follow these steps:

1. Open Sublime's command palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
1. Enter: Package Control: Install Package
1. Enter: Modelica

Syntax definitions will be applyed for all sources with 'mo' extention. Or you could manually enable syntax through command palette: 'Set Syntax: Modelica'.
